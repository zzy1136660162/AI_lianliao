//! D11 — Wave-2 app assembly smoke test.
//!
//! Minimum guarantee: after D7/D8/D9/D10 merged, `AppServices` composes into
//! a router that actually exposes the `/api/teams` endpoints. Anything beyond
//! compile-check is validated by `team_e2e.rs`; this file is kept intentionally
//! tiny so assembly regressions surface first.
