## Page Structure (7 slides)

| Slide | Type      | Description                                           |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | hero      | Neon block left-half, large title right               |
| 2     | pillars   | 4-column speaker showcase, small neon block top-right |
| 3     | statement | Centered message, neon blocks morph to corners        |
| 4     | pillars   | 3-column benefits, neon top stripe                    |
| 5     | evidence  | Large stat with neon background block                 |
| 6     | timeline  | 4-step process, vertical neon accent                  |
| 7     | cta       | Call to action, neon block returns to center          |

## Key Morph Patterns

- **Neon block actor** (`!!neon-block`): Large rect that moves from left-half → top-right → corners → top-stripe → background → vertical bar → center
- **Dramatic size changes**: Block scales from 16cm wide full-height down to 4cm accent strips
- **Color consistency**: Neon green stays constant, creating visual thread across slides
