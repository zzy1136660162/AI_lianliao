## Cowork — AI Agents That Work Alongside You

**AionUi is more than a chat client.** It's a Cowork platform where AI agents work alongside you on your computer — reading files, writing code, browsing the web, and automating tasks. You see everything the agent does, and you're always in control.

|                                 | Traditional AI Chat Clients | **AionUi (Cowork)**                                                                                                     |

## Built-in Agent — Install & Go, Zero Configuration

AionUi ships with a complete AI agent engine. Unlike tools that require you to install CLI agents separately, **AionUi works the moment you install it**.

- **No CLI tools to install** — the agent engine is built in
- **No complex setup** — paste any API key to get started
- **Full agent capabilities** — file read/write, web search, image generation, MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- **Ready-to-use assistants** — 21 built-in professional assistants (Cowork, PPT Creator, Word Creator, Word Form Creator, Excel Creator, Morph PPT, Morph PPT 3D, Pitch Deck Creator, Dashboard Creator, Academic Paper Writer, Financial Model Creator, and more) ready to use immediately

<p align="center">
  <img src="./resources/homepage.png" alt="Built-in Agents" width="800">
</p>

### **Office assistants — PPT, Word & Excel**

These tracks match what the app actually ships: **Morph PPT** presets and the **`pptx` / `docx` / `xlsx` skills** (see `assistant/` presets and `skills/` in the repo). Want document/table output? AionUi’s built-in **[OfficeCLI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI)** helps PPT (Morph), Word (`.docx`), and Excel (`.xlsx/.xlsm/.csv`) go from request to deliverable faster and more reliably.
The three assistant types map to file workflows, and the final outputs are directly editable and reusable.

#### **PPT assistant**

> **Output:** editable Morph PPT (`.pptx`)
> Morph-animated slide-to-slide transitions with coherent story pacing; powered by [OfficeCLI](https://github.com/iOfficeAI/OfficeCLI).

## Multi-Agent Mode — Already Have CLI Agents? Bring Them In

If you already use Claude Code, Codex, Hermes Agent, or OpenClaw, AionUi auto-detects them and lets you Cowork with all of them — alongside the built-in agent.

**Supported Agents:** Built-in Agent (zero setup) • Claude Code • Codex • Qwen Code • Goose AI • OpenClaw • Augment Code • CodeBuddy • Kimi CLI • OpenCode • Factory Droid • GitHub Copilot • Qoder CLI • Mistral Vibe • Nanobot • Aion CLI (aionrs, the Rust-based backend service shipped with AionUi) • Snow CLI • Hermes Agent • Cursor Agent and more

<p align="center">
  <img src="./resources/multi-agent支持openclaw.gif" alt="Multi-Agent Cowork" width="800">
</p>

- **Auto Detection** — automatically recognizes installed CLI tools
- **Unified Interface** — one Cowork platform for all your AI agents
- **Parallel Sessions** — run multiple agents simultaneously with independent context
- **MCP Unified Management** — configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools once, automatically sync to all agents — no need to configure each agent separately
- **YOLO Mode** (auto-approve all agent actions without manual confirmation) / **Full-Auto Mode** — one click to bypass permission prompts; all agents support full-auto mode for unattended execution

### Team Mode — Coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration

Run multiple AI agents as an organized team: a **Leader** agent receives your instructions, breaks them into subtasks, and delegates to **Teammate** agents via a built-in Team MCP Server. Teammates execute in parallel, share results through an async mailbox, and write to a shared task board.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./resources/AionUi_team.gif" alt="Team Mode overview" width="800">
</p>

- **Parallel multi-agent execution** — Leader breaks tasks into subtasks and delegates to Teammate agents running in parallel; each Teammate uses its own model via ACP (Agent Communication Protocol, AionUi's multi-agent coordination layer), Gemini, or Aionrs
- **Leader orchestration** — Leader assigns, tracks, and aggregates results; supported backends include Claude Code, Codex, Hermes Agent, Gemini, Snow CLI, and Aion CLI
- **Team-isolated workspace** — all agents share the same folder; each has its own permission dialog with sidebar badge for pending approvals

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 View Team Mode Details ▶️</strong></summary>

<br>

- **Shared Workspace** — all agents read/write the same folder; the file panel stays visible throughout
- **Supported backends** — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Snow CLI, Aion CLI (aionrs); other ACP backends with `mcpCapabilities.stdio` are auto-supported
- **Dynamic scaling** — add or remove Teammates while the team is running; silent agents auto-escalate to failed with one-click removal
- **Granular permissions** — each agent has its own permission confirmation dialog; sidebar badge shows pending approvals
- **File sharing** — Leader can pass file attachments to Teammates

</details>

## ✨ Cowork in Action

### **Scheduled Tasks — Cowork on Autopilot**

_Set it up once, the AI agent runs automatically on schedule — truly 24/7 unattended operation._

- **Natural Language** — tell the agent what to do, just like chatting
- **Three scheduling modes** — standard cron expression (with timezone), fixed interval (every N minutes/hours), or one-time trigger
- **AI-created tasks** — agents can autonomously create scheduled tasks during a conversation
- **Use Cases:** scheduled data aggregation, report generation, file organization, reminders

<p align="center">
  <img src="./resources/alart-task.png" alt="Scheduled Tasks" width="800">
</p>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 View Scheduled Task Details ▶️</strong></summary>

- `Every N minutes/hours` — fixed interval, e.g. run every 30 minutes
- `One-time` — trigger once at a specified datetime, then auto-disable

**Execution modes:**

- `Continue in existing conversation` — appends to the bound conversation so the AI retains full context history
- `Create new conversation each time` — opens a fresh session on each trigger, ideal for independent periodic reports

**Other capabilities:**

- **Conversation-Bound** — Each scheduled task is bound to a conversation, maintaining context and history
- **Automatic Execution** — Tasks run automatically at scheduled times, sending messages to the conversation
- **Easy Management** — Create, modify, enable/disable, delete, and view scheduled tasks anytime
- **Keep-awake** — AionUi automatically prevents system sleep while tasks are active, and detects missed triggers after wake
- **Advanced config** — each task can have its own model, workspace directory, and reasoning effort settings

**Real-World Examples:**

- Daily weather report generation
- Weekly sales data aggregation
- Monthly backup file organization
- Custom reminder notifications
