//! Assistant source classification + rule/skill dispatch traits used by
//! `skill_routes` to route rule-md / skill-md reads/writes to the correct
//! source (built-in file, extension resolution, or user-writable directory).
//!
//! These traits live in `aionui-extension` (not `aionui-assistant`) so
//! `skill_routes` can depend on them without pulling `aionui-assistant` into
//! the dependency graph; the concrete implementation ships from
//! `aionui-assistant::AssistantService`.
